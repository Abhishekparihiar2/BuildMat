Scope of Work (SOW)

Project: Construction Materials Marketplace (MVP)
Objective: Develop a web-based platform for users to list construction materials they want to sell or dispose of, and for seekers to find and connect with sellers.

1. Goals

Provide a simple and intuitive platform for material listing and searching.

Facilitate direct connection between sellers and buyers without complex intermediaries.

Ensure MVP is minimal yet functional, focusing on core features before scaling.

2. Target Users

Material Owners (Sellers/Disposers):
Users with construction materials (new, surplus, or used) they want to sell or give away.

Material Seekers (Buyers):
Users in need of construction materials who want to browse listings and contact owners.

3. User Flow
